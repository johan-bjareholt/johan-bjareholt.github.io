In May of 2015 i ordered the Ergodox Infinity from massdrop.
It was supposed to arrive in August, but it was sadly delayed until October (Atleast i was in the first batch, some people got it in late December).

Building it was simple and straight forward since most components were already soldered. The only thing I had to do was to solder the switches, place the stabilizers, screw together the layers of the case and put on the keycaps.

I am very satisfied with the results and have been playing around with the Kiibohd software alot, and make a simple drawing interface for the LCD.
