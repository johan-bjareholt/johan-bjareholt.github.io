During the Christmas holidays I wrote a simple diary application with GTK.
I did it because today I write in a diary app on my smartphone on days that I
do particular things on that I don't want to forget and I want to be able to
have a good app for that once I will receive my first Linux phone (Librem 5).

It is currently very basic and I got it submitted to flathub, so it can easily
be installed on Linux appstores such as Gnome Software if you have the flathub
repository added!
