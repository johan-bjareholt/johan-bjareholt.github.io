It actually happened...

Me and my brother nominated each other for our Open Source projects to LUFOSS, a scholarship made to embrace students and graduate students to contribute with Open Source.
I certainly didn't expect us both to become finalists, but we both are and I am honored to be.

The award ceremony will be at 27th April, I'm really excited!
